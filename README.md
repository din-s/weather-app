In current stage,
App does not have a User Interface,
hence is only accessible from CMD / Terminal

Before running script, please register yourself, or get an api key from https://www.weatherapi.com as is required to make request to remote server.

Then add this api key to the API_KEY variable in ./apiCall.js file.

Then in your terminal or cmd run,
node app.js get -l "yourLocation"
